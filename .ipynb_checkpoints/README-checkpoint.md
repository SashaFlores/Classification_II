# Classification (Part.  1)

In this directory, weâ€™ll learn about classification algorithms

1. LOGISTIC REGRESSION
2. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES

Cases examined:

* Fraud detection
* Price and ROI forecasting
* Medical disease/condition diagnosis

I prefer to include all illustrations in the notebook for each topic as we building up the models.
